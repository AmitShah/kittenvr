### Overview
Kitten VR began as an experiment with building low poly environments in Unity 5, and quickly turned into a simple application with a lot of potential. My goals with Kitten VR are twofold: to have a simple, easy to play mini-game for use with virtual reality devices that I can use as a basis for testing new VR SDKs, and to document the process for those interested in learning how to build applications that take advantage of today's VR ecosystem themselves.

Right now, I'm using the Oculus Runtime 0.5.1 and the Unity plugin for 0.4.4 (newer versions don't work well with Unity 5, so I'm improvising for the time being). UPDATE 5/27: I've upgraded to the .5.X version of the Unity plugin after switching over to Windows & things are working like a charm. Holding on .6.X until the plugin fix for input controls are in.

Downloadable versions should be arriving shortly after fixing the most prominent bugs. If there's specific input device or SDK you'd like to see me (attempt!) to support, please let me know!
